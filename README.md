# Clock and Weather display

This is my first project, it's a simple website that displays the current time on the clock and has weather information/forecast available when you enter the name of the city and country you want to check.

> I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also OpenWeather's API to get the weather information.

The background image will change based on the time of the day; it will display a different background for daytime, afternoon and nighttime.

Feel free to access the website by <a href="https://clock-and-weather.vercel.app/">clicking here<a/>!

I'm very proud to post my very first project here! ðŸ’œ
